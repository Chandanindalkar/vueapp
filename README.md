# MODAL
```
The Modal component lets you create dialogs, popovers, lightboxes, and other elements that force the user to take action before continuing.
```

# Props
```
Props are a way to pass data from the parent component to the child component.

It is a good practice to pass data from parent to child rather than having data present in the child.
